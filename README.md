Pick&Place project for the Robot Control course, UV Ljubljana.

## Comm. between PC and Robot

The communication is done by TCP, with Python as language.

Tips :
- As both the host PC and the robot are DHCP, the hardcoded ip address has to be changed at every session.
- The Python code acts as server, robot always as client.
- The robot never indicates directly when the connection is severed.
